# YSDA course "Natural Language Processing".

Repository contains my solutions for tasks that were offered on open YSDA [course](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course) "Natural Language Processing".

# Implemented tasks

+ ## [Multilingual Embedding-based Machine Translation](https://github.com/grgera/YSDA-nlp/blob/main/Solutions/1_homework.ipynb)
Make machine translation system with two kindred Slavic languages: Ukrainian and Russian.

+ ## [Prohibited Comment Classification](https://github.com/grgera/YSDA-nlp/blob/main/Solutions/2_homework.ipynb)
Build an algorithm that classifies social media comments into normal or toxic. Solving it with `Bag of Words`, `TF-IDF` and `FastText`.

+ ## [Language Modeling](https://github.com/grgera/YSDA-nlp/blob/main/Solutions/3_homework.ipynb)
How to write scientific papers? Train language model on a corpora of ArXiv articles and see if we can generate a new one!

+ ## [Machine Translation](https://github.com/grgera/YSDA-nlp/blob/main/Solutions/4_Attention.ipynb) 
Implementation encoder-decoder Seq2seq model with `Attention` and `BPE` tokens.

+ ## [Named Entity Recognition](https://github.com/grgera/YSDA-nlp/blob/main/Solutions/5_homework/5_homework.ipynb)
Research of the `NER` problem with different source and target domains of data.
